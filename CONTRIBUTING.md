# How to contribute to Infinite Fusion
_Notice: These instructions are written by a contributor who learned this through trial and error. Easier methods and other changes can and should be edited in._

***This document assumes that you have some basic development setup already in place***

## Prerequisites
1. Git
2. RPG Maker XP
3. Visual Studio Code or some other IDE (optional, but recommended)

## Getting started
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your computer into an empty folder
3. Download Pokemon Essentials (the whole thing, not just the repository)
4. Either extract PE into the cloned IF repository and *don't* let it overwrite any files (I have not tested this) or extract it normally into the folder you want to use for development and then copy and paste in the cloned IF repository, overwriting files
